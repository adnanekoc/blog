                <p>Audi is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany.
                       The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises  founded by engineer August Horch. The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. Horch, meaning 'listen', becomes audi in Latin. 
                      <br> I love audi cars.It is very comfortable and conveinent.

                <h2>BEARING</h2>
                <article>
                    <h3><a href="post.html"></a></h3>
                    <p>A bearing is a machine element that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion and reduces friction between moving parts.
                        The design of the bearing may, for example, provide for free linear movement of the moving part or for free rotation around a fixed axis; or, it may prevent a motion by controlling the vectors of normal forces that bear on the moving parts. 
                        Most bearings facilitate the desired motion by minimizing friction.
                        Bearings are classified broadly according to the type of operation, the motions allowed, or the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts.
                       <br>Bearing is my life because my father does this job. I do this job on the days I don't go to school, so I know a lot about bearings.
                        Bearings are important because they are needed in every sector.
                        I will continue this job with  together software engineering in the future.
